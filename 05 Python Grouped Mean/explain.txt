##Python Grouped Mean
Given a data file containing data about irises, find the grouped mean of a numeric column, sepal width, grouped by a categorical column, species, using NumPy.

A mean of grouped data is the process of finding the average of a set of data that are grouped together in different categories.

The URL where the data exists is already provided in the program, along with the columns names.

The data will look like the following, where the first column is the sepal width and the fourth column is the species:

5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
...
7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,Iris-versicolor
6.4,3.2,4.5,1.5,Iris-versicolor
...
6.0,2.2,5.0,1.5,Iris-virginica
6.9,3.2,5.7,2.3,Iris-virginica


The expected output should be in the following format:

[b'Iris-setosa', 1.1111]
[b'Iris-versicolor', 2.22222]
[b'Iris-virginica', 3.3333]
